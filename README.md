💡 Welcome to the "Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI" course! The course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to build and customize multi-agent systems using crewAI framework.

## Course Summary
In this course, you'll explore key principles of designing multi-agent systems and enabling agents to collaborate on complex tasks using the AutoGen framework. Here's what you can expect to learn and experience:

1.  **Crew Agents**: Create a three-agent chat showing a conversation between three agents regarding writing an article using specific roles, goals and backstories for the agents.

2.  **Customer Support**: Develop a sequence of chats between agents to provide a satifying customer support experience for crewAI using the multi-agent crew collaboration.

3.  **Tools for a Customer Outreach Campaign**: Using tools to support the agent in reading files and reading directories as well as creating a custom tool for sentiment analysis.

4.  **Automate Event Planninge**: Implement a conversational event planning system where multiple agents play a role to plan and execute an event plan including a Pydantic Object to populate information regarding venues.

5.  **Multi-agent Collaboration for Financial Analysis**: Create systems where agents collaborate and feedback from respective agents to complete a financial analysis task. Includes delegation of tasks from one agent to the other if better suited for the task.

6.  **Resume Finetuning**: Create systems where agents collaborate and based on the job posting finetune a original resume of a particular person to best showcase their qualifications suitable for the role. Includes Async execution.


By the end of the course, you’ll have hands-on experience with crewAI’s core components and a solid understanding of agentic design patterns, ready to implement multi-agent systems in your workflows.
